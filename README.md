# ClassProjectApp
Collaborated with a classmate to create an app that stores multiple passwords from any account.
The language that was used was React Native js.
Purpose: 
         Keep the userâ€™s accounts and passwords in one place and safe from common hackers.
         Keep all accounts and passwords in one spot.
         Notify the user if any of their passwords have been used before.
